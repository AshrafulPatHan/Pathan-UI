**Pathan UI** is a free, open-source UI component library built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It provides a collection of beautiful, reusable, and customizable components to help frontend React developers build modern web applications faster.

With **33 ready-to-use components**, Pathan UI focuses on simplicity, performance, and developer experience. All components are styled using Tailwind CSS, with some animations powered by pure CSS, GSAP, or Framer Motion.
